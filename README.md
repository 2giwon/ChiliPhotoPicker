# ChiliPhotoPicker

Library made without DataBinding, RxJava and image loading libraries, to give you opportunity to use it without additional dependencies.

![](images/example.gif)

- Picker styled as bottom sheet dialog
- Could be used for single or multiple photos pick
- Allows to choose how images are loaded into ImageView
- Takes responsibility for all needed permissions
- Takes responsibility for fetching gallery/camera result


| No permission                   | Single choice                      | Multiple choice                   |

## Setup

Gradle:

Add Jitpack to your root `build.gradle` file:

```
allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        jcenter()
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
}
```

Add dependency to application `build.gradle` file, where `x.y.z` is the latest [release version](https://github.com/ChiliLabs/ChiliPhotoPicker/releases):

[![](https://jitpack.io/v/ChiliLabs/ChiliPhotoPicker.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#ChiliLabs/ChiliPhotoPicker)

```
implementation "com.github.ChiliLabs:ChiliPhotoPicker:x.y.z"
```

## Usage

- Create new instance of `ImagePickerFragment`
- Pass preferred `ImageLoader` implementation (ready examples for Glide and Picasso are [here](https://github.com/ChiliLabs/ChiliPhotoPicker/tree/master/sample/src/main/java/lv/chi/picker/loaders))
- Pass your file provider authority, so we can store temporary photo from camera
- Show as dialog

``` kotlin
ImagePickerFragment.newInstance(multiple = true)
            .imageLoader(GlideImageLoader())
            .authority("com.example.your.fileprovider")
            .show(supportFragmentManager, YOUR_TAG)
```

### ImageLoader

We don't want to depend on many image loading libraries, so we have simple `ImageLoader` interface, which you can implement using your preferred library (Glide, Picasso, Coil, etc.)
We have two working examples of `ImageLoader` implementations - using [Glide](https://github.com/ChiliLabs/ChiliPhotoPicker/blob/master/sample/src/main/java/lv/chi/picker/loaders/GlideImageLoader.kt) and [Picasso](https://github.com/ChiliLabs/ChiliPhotoPicker/blob/master/sample/src/main/java/lv/chi/picker/loaders/PicassoImageLoader.kt). You can just copy one of them or write your own implementation

### Callback

Picked photos URIs are returned via callbacks `onImagesPicked` function, so you just need to implement `ImagePickerFragment.Callback` interface in your activity or fragment
